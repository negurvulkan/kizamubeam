## Building

Requirements: Node.js 20+, Rust (stable), on Linux also `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`, `librsvg2-dev`, `build-essential`, `libssl-dev`
(see https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/).

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev      # desktop app with live reload
npm run dev            # UI only, in the browser: http://localhost:1420
npm run tauri build    # installer package
```

On Windows, `npm run tauri build` only builds the NSIS installer (`.exe`, see `src-tauri/tauri.windows.conf.json`), because the MSI installer does not accept pre-release versions such as `1.2.0-beta`. This stays the same for stable versions: a second installer could create a second, separate installation, and beta versions would no longer build. On Linux it builds AppImage and .deb; RPM does not accept a hyphen in the version (see `src-tauri/tauri.linux.conf.json`), so the release workflow builds the .rpm only for stable versions such as `2.2.0`.

Releases: publishing a release on GitHub (Releases → Draft a new release → new tag → Publish release) runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds the installers for macOS (universal, Apple Silicon and Intel), Windows (NSIS) and Linux (AppImage, .deb, plus .rpm for stable versions) and attaches them to that release. An already published release can be built with Actions → Release → Run workflow. The builds are not code-signed yet, so macOS and Windows show a warning on first launch.

Updates: Help → Check for Updates looks for a newer release on GitHub (channel Stable, or Nightly including nightly builds and release candidates; by default once a day at startup; a stored former Beta channel counts as Stable), verifies its signature and installs it. This needs an updater key pair (`npx tauri signer generate -w ~/.tauri/kizamubeam.key`): the private key as repository secret `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` (and its password as `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`), the public key as repository variable `TAURI_UPDATER_PUBKEY`. Builds without the key cannot update themselves. On Linux, updating works for the AppImage.

Nightly builds: `.github/workflows/nightly.yml` runs once a night. If `main` has new commits since the last nightly and the CI workflow is green on them, it creates a pre-release `v<next>-nightly.<YYYYMMDD>.<run>` (`<next>` = next minor version after a stable version, e.g. 2.8.0 → 2.9.0, or the version without its pre-release part, e.g. 2.9.0-rc.1 → 2.9.0) and builds it with `release.yml`, which writes that version into `package.json` and `tauri.conf.json` for the build only. A nightly whose build fails is deleted, and only the newest 7 are kept. There are no regular beta releases any more; before a stable release, tag a release candidate such as `v2.9.0-rc.1`, which reaches the Nightly channel. Manual run: Actions → Nightly → Run workflow (“force” builds even without new commits).

Virtual Machine: the virtual laser machine is a separate Tauri program in the `vm/` folder (UI in `vm/src/`, Rust in `vm/src-tauri/`, the controller without UI in `vm/src-tauri/core/`, crate `kizamubeam-vm-core`). It uses the packages from the main folder. `npm run vm` starts it with live reload (port 1421, KizamuBeam uses 1420), `npm run vm:build` builds the installer, `npm run vm:headless` runs it without a window (`-- --help` lists the options), `npm run test:vm` tests the controller. VM releases have their own tags `vm-v0.1.0` (version from `vm/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`) and are published as pre-releases so they never count as the latest release on GitHub; `.github/workflows/vm-release.yml` builds them, `release.yml` skips them, and KizamuBeam’s update check only considers tags starting with `v` and a digit.

## Translations

The step-by-step guide for translators (app, website, README, feature list) is [TRANSLATION.md](../TRANSLATION.md). The technical details:

UI texts are written in German in the code inside `t('…')` (placeholders in curly braces, `t('{n} Bilder', { n })`; singular/plural with `tn('{n} Bild', '{n} Bilder', n)`). Every text that shows a count uses `tn()`; the form follows the plural rules of the shown language (`Intl.PluralRules`), so the translation of the singular is that language's "one" form (in French also 0). If the German singular and plural read the same, the singular gets the context `|one`: `tn('{n} Fehler|one', '{n} Fehler', n)`. Languages with more forms add them to their file as `"<plural text>|few"`, `|many`, `|two` or `|zero`; missing ones fall back to the plural. `npm run i18n:check` reports `tn()` calls with identical keys. The German text is also the key in the language files `src/locales/<language>.json`. If a translation is missing, the English text is shown, otherwise the German one. If the same German text has two meanings, it gets a context after `|`, e.g. `t('Verbindung|Gerät')`.

- `npm run i18n:check` lists missing, unused and misplaced entries (fails if anything is missing).
- `npm run i18n:check -- --write` adds new texts with an empty value and removes unused ones; afterwards only the empty values need translating.
- New language: create `src/locales/fr.json` (e.g. a copy of `en.json` with empty values). Nothing else needs registering: the app finds every file in `src/locales/` on its own, the file name is the language code (`fr`, `pt-BR`), and the name in View → Language, the number and date formats and the decimal separator come from the browser's `Intl`. The system language picks the file automatically. `npm run i18n:check` also checks that the file name is a valid language code. The Virtual Machine shares the list; its own texts are only translated to English, which other languages get as well.
- Messages from the Rust side are in German and are translated in `src/i18n.ts` (`tBackend`).

Network cameras in KizamuBeam: `src-tauri/src/netcam.rs`. Tests: `npm run test:vm` (burn maps, cut-out detection and controller) |
| `src-tauri/src/native.rs` | Computation core for the UI: image grayscale data and finished G-code stay in Rust |
| `src/native.ts` | Calls into the computation core from the UI |

Internally the editor works in mm with y pointing down; the display uses machine coordinates (origin at the bottom left).

## Logo

Logo files are in [`docs/brand/`](brand/): logo with symbol, wordmark, symbol in color and monochrome, symbol above the wordmark, each also as `-dark` for dark backgrounds, plus the app icon (`kizamubeam-app-icon.png`, source for `npx tauri icon`).
